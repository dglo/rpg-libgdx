rpg-libgdx
==========

The GUI for my roguelike.  More technically, this is the View and
Control code which interacts with the Model classes from rpg-core.

This code depends on `rpg-core` having been built and installed into
your local Maven repository.

Currently only the 'desktop' client is working.  The
`build-and-run` script does what the name says; it builds and installs
the desktop interface and, if that's successful, opens a window on
your desktop running the program.
